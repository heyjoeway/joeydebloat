My personal config for miniwindeploy

# Getting Started

In an admin Powershell prompt:
```
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heyjoeway/joeydebloat/main/download.ps1'))
```

This will install Python 3 and Git, then clone this repo and open it in File Explorer. From there, change whatever scripts you'd like then open `Start.bat`.
